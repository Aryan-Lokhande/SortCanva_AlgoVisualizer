# SortCanva: Algorithm Visualization Web App

![Demo Link](https://x-infin1ty-x.github.io/SortCanva_AlgoVisualizer/main.html)

SortCanva is a web development project that allows real-time visualization of sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort and Quick Sort, as well as pathfinding algorithms(Underway). This web app provides an interactive way to understand and learn about these algorithms through visualizations. 

## Features
- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms.
- Support for popular sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
- Pathfinding algorithm visualization for solving various graph-related problems.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/x-infin1ty-x/SortCanva_AlgoVisualizer.git
